    <h1>North Lindsey IT Services Ltd</h1>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We are a privately owned IT Service Company based in the United Kingdom.<br>
      The directors are David and Louise Baxendale.</p>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>We provide niche digital information services (web sites, web portals, mobile phone apps) that hopefully inform
      and
      entertain.<br>
      These services are funded by donation, subscription, advertising or associated product sales which may be
      fulfilled
      directly or via 3rd parties.<br>
      David specializes in the technical delivery while Louise specializes in the management of the content and
      associated marketing.</p>
    <h2>Funny Name</h2>
    <p>The old Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Lindsey lay between the Humber estuary and the Wash.<br>
      When the English shires were established, Lindsey became part of Lincolnshire along with Kesteven and Holland.<br>
      The new Part of Lindsey was itself divided into three ridings North, West and South.<br>
      The company is based in North Lincolnshire - a unitary authority which succeeds parts of the ridings of
      Lindsey.<br>
      Hence the name North Lindsey IT Services Ltd - we also use the acronym NLIT because it's shorter, sounds techier
      and is easier to remember.</p>
